The missing utility for macOS.

How many times have you ever wondered how to get all your templates for your documents together in one application? So it would be easy to create quickly a document and start working. Or just a new document in the location that you want.

New File Creation is a small utility that allows you to do this: to have a group of default documents or to configure your own set of documents and be able to drag them where you need to start quickly with that document. As easy as drag and drop.

In addition, New File Creation has an extension for OS X that allows you, using the context menu by clicking anywhere, to create directly a document of your choice in any location at glance: this can be a blank document or template based on a document you've created in any application!.

New File Creation eliminates tedious tasks like opening the application, create a new document and move it where you need it: all these steps at a time and you can get to work. And ... with your own templates, any application, all gathered in one app!

New feature: Brand new Touch bar support!!! Get your templates at glance in your touch bar, swipe right or left and touch you template to create a new one, touch bar is available on Mac OS 10.12.2 and above.
